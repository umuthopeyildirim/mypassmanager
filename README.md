# MyPass Manager

MyPass Manager is a simple password manager that uses the [MyPass](https://mypassmanager.ml) API to store your passwords.

## Installation
MyPass Manager uses Firebase for backend stuff, so you need to create a Firebase project and add your project api key to `.env` file. You can find the api key in your Firebase project settings.
