                    81% of data breaches are caused by weak or reused passwords. 
                    To keep your information secure, you need a strong, unique password for every account. 
                    But when you have hundreds of accounts, how do you keep track of all your passwords?
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's where password managers come in. 
                    They help you create strong passwords and sign in to your accounts quickly.

                    MyPass Manager saves all your passwords and encrypts them with your Account Password - which only you know. 
                    To sign in to an account, just click or tap to fill your details with MyPass Manager.
